`pathviewR` offers tools to import, clean, and visualize animal movement
data from [Optitrack‚Äôs Motive](https://optitrack.com/products/motive/),
the Straw Lab‚Äôs [Flydra](https://github.com/strawlab/flydra), or from
other sources. We provide functions to remove artifacts, standardize
tunnel position and tunnel axes, select a region of interest, isolate
specific trajectories, fill gaps in trajectory data, and calculate 3D
and per-axis velocity. For experiments of visual guidance, we also
provide functions that use animal position to estimate perception of
visual stimuli.

## Installation

This package can be installed via:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools") # if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("vbaliga/pathviewR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(pathviewR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

üê¢

Note to self: You‚Äôll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to
keep `README.md` up-to-date. Do this via `devtools::build_readme()`

Let‚Äôs see if the github action works.
