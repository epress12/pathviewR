`pathviewR` offers tools to import, clean, and visualize animal movement
data from [Optitrack‚Äôs Motive](https://optitrack.com/products/motive/),
the Straw Lab‚Äôs [Flydra](https://github.com/strawlab/flydra), or from
other sources. We provide functions to remove artifacts, standardize
tunnel position and tunnel axes, select a region of interest, isolate
specific trajectories, fill gaps in trajectory data, and calculate 3D
and per-axis velocity. For experiments of visual guidance, we also
provide functions that use animal position to estimate perception of
visual stimuli.

## Installation

This package can be installed via:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools") # if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("vbaliga/pathviewR")
```

## Example

Data import and cleaning via `pathviewR`

``` r
## If you do not already have pathviewR installed:
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("vbaliga/pathviewR")

library(pathviewR)
library(tidyverse)
```

We will import and clean a sample data set from `.csv` files exported by
[Optitrack‚Äôs Motive](https://optitrack.com/products/motive/) software.
For examples of how to import and clean other types of data, see the
data import and cleaning vignette. \[link to vignette\]

``` r
## Import the Motive example data included in 
## the package

motive_data <-
  read_motive_csv(
    system.file("extdata", "pathviewR_motive_example_data.csv",
                package = 'pathviewR')
  )
```

Several functions to clean and wrangle data are available, and we have a
suggested pipeline for how these steps should be handled. For this
example, we will use one of two ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù functions: `clean_viewr()`.
See the data import and cleaning vignette for the full pipeline and the
other ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù function.\[link to vignette\]

``` r
motive_allinone <-
  motive_data %>%
  clean_viewr(
    relabel_viewr_axes = TRUE,
    gather_tunnel_data = TRUE,
    trim_tunnel_outliers = TRUE,
    standardization_option = "rotate_tunnel",
    select_x_percent = TRUE,
    desired_percent = 50,
    rename_viewr_characters = FALSE,
    separate_trajectories = TRUE,
    max_frame_gap = "autodetect",
    get_full_trajectories = TRUE,
    span = 0.95
  )
#> autodetect is an experimental feature -- please report issues.

## Quick plot
plot(motive_allinone$position_length,
     motive_allinone$position_width,
     asp = 1, col = as.factor(motive_allinone$file_sub_traj))
```

An important aspect of how `pathviewR` defines trajectories is by
managing gaps in the data. See the Managing Frame Gaps vignette for more
information on trajectory definition and frame gaps. \[link to
vignette\]

Now that the data is cleaned, `pathviewR` includes functions that
estimate visual perceptions based on the distance between the
subject/observer and visual stimuli on the walls of the experimental
tunnel. For a complete description of these functions, see the Visual
Perception Functions vignette. \[link to vignette\]

Now that our objects have been cleaned, we will use
`insert_treatments()` to add information about the experiments that are
necessary for calculating visual perceptions.

``` r
motive_V <- 
  motive_allinone %>% 
  insert_treatments(vertex_height = -0.3855,
                    vertex_angle = 45,
                    stim_param_pos = 0.1,
                    stim_param_neg = 0.2,
                    treatment = "latB")
```

To calculate the spatial frequency of the visual stimuli as perceived by
the subject some distance from the stimuli, we will use `calc_sf_V()`.

The resulting object contains 10 new variables which are values involved
in the calculation of spatial frequency.

``` r
motive_V_sf <- 
  motive_V %>%
  calc_sf_V(simplify_output = FALSE)
```

To calculate an estimation of the visual angles perceived by the
subject, we will use `calc_vis_angle_V`.

The resulting object contains 12 new variables which are values involved
in the calculation of visual angles.

``` r
motive_V_angle <- 
  motive_V %>% 
  calc_vis_angle_V(simplify_output=FALSE)
```

Visualizing the calculations provides an more intuitive understanding of
how these visual perceptions change as the subject moves throughout the
tunnel. Please see the Visual Perception Functions for more examples of
visualizing calculations. \[link to vignette\]

``` r
ggplot(motive_V_sf, aes(x = position_width, y = position_height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = sf_pos), shape=1, size=3) +
  coord_fixed() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # dimensions of the positive wall
                  y = -0.3855,
                  xend = 0.5869,
                  yend = 0.2014)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # dimensions of the negative wall
                   y = -0.3855,
                   xend = -0.5869,
                   yend = 0.2014))
```
