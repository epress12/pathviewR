`pathviewR` offers tools to import, clean, and visualize animal movement data
from [Optitrack's Motive](https://optitrack.com/products/motive/), the Straw
Lab's [Flydra](https://github.com/strawlab/flydra), or from other sources. We
provide functions to remove artifacts, standardize tunnel position and tunnel
axes, select a region of interest, isolate specific trajectories, fill gaps in
trajectory data, and calculate 3D and per-axis velocity. For experiments of
visual guidance, we also provide functions that use animal position to estimate
perception of visual stimuli.

## Installation

This package can be installed via:
``` r
#install.packages("devtools") # if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("vbaliga/pathviewR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(pathviewR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? 
You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Citation

TBD

## License

GPL (>= 3) + file LICENSE

üê¢

Note to self: You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep
`README.md` up-to-date. Do this via `devtools::build_readme()`
