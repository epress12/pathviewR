The goal of pathviewR is to ...

## Installation

This package can be installed via:
``` r
#install.packages("devtools") # if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("vbaliga/pathviewR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(pathviewR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? 
You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Citation

TBD

## License

üê¢

Note to self: You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep
`README.md` up-to-date. Do this via `devtools::build_readme()`

You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render R`EADME.Rmd ` very time you push.
An example workflow can be found in the e`examples/`directory here:
https://github.com/r-lib/actions/
