## Data import via `pathviewR`

In this vignette, we will provide an overview of how data may be imported and wrangled to prepare data objects for analyses. 

At present, we offer support for `.csv` files exported from Optitrack's Motive software (link) as well as `.mat` files exported from Flydra (link).

We'll begin by loading `pathviewR` and a few other packages

```{r package_loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(pathviewR)
library(tidyverse)
```

To be continued...
