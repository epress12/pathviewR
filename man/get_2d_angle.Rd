\title{Compute an angle in 2D space}
\usage{
get_2d_angle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{x-coordinate of first point}

\item{y1}{y-coordinate of first point}

\item{x2}{x-coordinate of second point (vertex)}

\item{y2}{y-coordinate of second point (vertex)}

\item{x3}{x-coordinate of third point}

\item{y3}{y-coordinate of third point}
}
\value{
A numeric vector that provides the angular measurement in degrees.
}
\description{
Compute an angle in 2D space
}
\details{
Everything supplied to arguments must be singular numeric values.
The second point (x2, y2) is treated as the vertex, and the angle beween
the three points in 2D space is computed.
