\title{Estimate spatial frequency of visual stimuli in rectangular tunnel, i.e. box}
\usage{
calc_sf_box(obj_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj_name}{The input viewr object; a tibble or data.frame with attribute
\code{pathviewR_steps} that includes \code{"viewr"}}
}
\value{
A tibble or data.frame with added variables \code{min_dist_pos} and
\code{min_dist_neg} describing the minimum distance to the tunnel walls as
well as \code{s_freq_pos} and \code{s_freq_neg} reported in cycles per 1Ëš of
visual angle.
}
\description{
Based on rigid body, i.e animal head positions in a box shaped tunnel,
\code{calc_sf_box()} calculates how the animal perceives the visual stimuli
in terms of its spatial frequency modulated by distance to the stimulus.
}
\details{
\code{calc_sf_box} assumes fixed gaze at the point on the
either side of the tunnel that minimizes the distance to visual stimuli and
thereby minimizes spatial frequencies.
