\usage{
calc_sf_V(
  obj_name,
  gnd_plane,
  stim_param_pos,
  stim_param_neg,
  vertex_angle = 45,
  simplify_output = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj_name}{A tibble or data.frame with attribute \code{viewr}}

\item{gnd_plane}{The vertical distance (in meters) between the bottom of the
"V" and the horizontal plane through the origin (0,0,0).}

\item{stim_param_pos}{The length (in meters) of the visual stimulus presented
on the positive side of the tunnel (i.e. \code{position_width >= 0}). For
example, a sinusoidal grating 10cm wide is \code{stim_param_pos = 0.1}}

\item{stim_param_neg}{The same convention as \code{stim_param_pos} but for
stimuli presented on the negative side of the tunnel
(i.e. \code{position_width < 0}).}

\item{vertex_angle}{The angle (in degrees) subtended by a vertical axis and
the sides of the tunnel. Equivalent to the angle of the "V" divided by 2.
\code{vertex_angle)} defaults to 45.}

\item{simplify_output}{If TRUE, the returned object includes minimum distance
as well as the spatial freqencies perceived on either side of the
tunnel. If FALSE, the returned object includes all variables internal to the
calculation.}
}
\value{
A tibble or data.frame with added variables for
\code{s_freq_pos} and \code{s_freq_neg} reported in cycles per 1Ëš of visual
angle.
}
\description{
Based on rigid body, i.e animal head positions in a "V" shaped tunnel,
\code{calc_sf_V()} calculates how the animal percieves the visual stimuli
in terms of its spatial frequency modulated by distance to the stimulus.
}
\details{
\code{cal_sf_V} assumes fixed gaze at the point on the
either side of the tunnel that minimizes the distance to visual stimuli and
thereby minimizes spatial frequencies.
